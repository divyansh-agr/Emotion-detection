## Overview

**Emotion Detection** is a project aimed at identifying and analyzing human emotions from various data sources using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The core of the repository is implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** (75.4%) and **Python** (24.6%), making it interactive and easy to extend for research or production use.

## Features

- **Emotion Recognition**: Detects emotions from text, images, or audio data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Leverages popular ML and DL libraries for accurate results.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step experimentation, visualization, and analysis.
- **Extensible Pipeline**: Easy to add new models, datasets, and emotion categories.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divyansh-agr/Emotion-detection.git
   cd Emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  Open the notebooks in the repository using Jupyter:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  Explore the available notebooks for training models, evaluating emotion detection, and visualizing results.

- **Python Scripts:**
  Some utility scripts and modules can be run directly:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py
  ```

## Example

Here is a minimal example of using a pre-trained model to detect emotion from text:

```python
from emotion_detector import predict_emotion

text = "I am feeling happy today!"
emotion = predict_emotion(text)
print(f"Detected Emotion: {emotion}")
```
